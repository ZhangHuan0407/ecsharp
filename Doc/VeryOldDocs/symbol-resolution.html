<h1>Loyc's symbol resolution system</h1>


<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Different languages look up
symbols in different ways. For example, given a base class and derived
class that both have a function f()...<br>
<pre>class A     { void f(short x); }<br>class B : A { void f(int x); }<br></pre>


When someone tries to call the function using<br>
<pre>B b;<br>...<br>b.f(10);<br></pre>
A C++ compiler will only consider calling B.f(), for it shadows A.f().
A C# compiler, on the other hand, will consider both. But what if A and
B are written in C# and the call is made from C++? What should the rule
be then?<br>
<br>
Loyc is supposed to be flexible, so I believe&nbsp;either behavior
should be possible. A design is required that makes either behavior
possible. Although there are no plans to support C++ in Loyc currently,
it is important that the capabilities of virtually any language can be
integrated into the Loyc system. One of the more interesting features
of C++ is that you can overload operator -&gt; (this operator is like
the dot operator in&nbsp;C#/Java/C/C++, except that it is used on
pointers rather than&nbsp;classes/structures). For example:<br>
<pre>class A { <br>	public: void f(short x);<br>};<br>class APtr { <br>	private: A _a;<br>	public: A* operator-&gt;() { return &amp;_a; }<br>};<br><br>APtr A;<br>A-&gt;f(10); // Calls f() in class A<br></pre>
It's interesting because it causes method lookups to occur in a
different class. Wouldn't it be cool, I always thought, if you could
override the dot operator?<br>
<pre>class A {<br>	public: void f(int x);<br>};<br>class B {<br>	private: A _a;<br>	public: void g(int x);<br>	public: A* operator.() { return &amp;_a; }<br>};</pre>
Ahh, now that's interesting, because we could write C++ code like<br>
<pre>B b;<br>b.f(10);<br>b.g(10);<br></pre>
In summary, class A appears to become part of class B, even though they
are not related by inheritance. If B's methods take precedence over
A's, one can envision a very easy way to implement the decorator
pattern using C++ templates. Of course, Loyc will make this feature
possible.<br>
<br>
Consider also C# 3.0's extension methods:<br>
<pre>public class A {<br>	public void f(int x);<br>};<br>public static class B {<br>	public static void g(this A self, int x);<br>};<br><br>A a = new A();<br>a.f(10);<br>a.g(10);<br></pre>
All these features affect the way <span style="font-style: italic;">candidate methods</span> are selected at a call site, and the priorities between different candidates.<br>
<br>
Right now you can "explicitly implement interface methods" like so:<br>
<pre>	class Disposable : IDisposable<br>	{<br>		void IDisposable.Dispose() {}<br>	}</pre>
Right now the following call is illegal, but I say it should be possible:<br>
<pre>(new Disposable()).IDisposable.Dispose();</pre>
In fact, let's take it a step further. Often you'll see a class that
provides part of its functionality in a separate object; for example,
the ListView control provides an Items property which lets you modify
the list. Although it is technically&nbsp;a separate list object, it is
tightly bound to the control and cannot exist independently, nor be
shared between multiple ListView controls. I think it is good design to
classify different parts of an object and supply separate interfaces
for each part, because it makes the class design more readily
understandable (provided that the user understands that the separate
interfaces have a 1:1 correspondence to each other.) For example, the
design of the following class may not be immediately apparent:<br>
<pre>class TODO {<br>  ... many members in alphabetical order<br>}</pre>
<br>
