<h1>Loyc: Build the Language Of Your Choice</h1>

<span style="font-style: italic;">A multi-language
compiler and a modular, extensible compiler framework (still in design
phase)</span><br>

[ <span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span>
| <a href="design-ov.html">Design overview</a> | <a href="50features.html">Extension proposals</a> | <a href="http://qism.blogspot.com">My blog</a> ]<br>

<br>

Various programming paradigms have been
developed, all of which are useful:
<ul>

  <li>Object-oriented programming (C++, Java, C#, Eiffel, Python,
Ruby, ...) </li>

  <li>Functional programming (Haskell, ML, ...) vs. logic
programming (Prolog, ...) vs imperative programming (most languages) </li>

  <li>Static vs. dynamic typing (Java vs. Python) </li>

</ul>

And I've heard of a lot of ideas for
specific features:
<ul>

  <li>Various forms of type inference (Haskell, ML, boo, <a href="http://nemerle.org/Type_inference">Nemerle</a>) </li>

  <li>Parallel constructs (Fortress) </li>

  <li>Inner functions and lambda expressions </li>

  <li>Unit checking (&ldquo;Error: expected measurement in
pixels, got centimetres instead&rdquo;) </li>

  <li>Coroutines, generators, continuations (non-stack-based
function calls) </li>

  <li>Delegates </li>

  <li>Overloaded operators </li>

  <li>Custom operators (as in Haskell) </li>

  <li>Parameterized types (C# generics and C++ templates, which
are substantially different from each other) </li>

  <li>Lexical macros (C, C++) </li>

  <li>Reflection (C#, Java) </li>

  <li>Checking of preconditions, postconditions and invariants
(Eiffel) </li>

  <li>Multiple inheritance (C++, Eiffel) </li>

  <li>Interfaces (Java, .NET) </li>

  <li>Traits (Fortress) </li>

  <li>Garbage collection (most languages other than C/C++)</li>

  <li>Two-stage and multistage programming (running code at
compile time)</li>

  <li>Metaprogramming</li>

  <li>Inline assembly </li>

  <li>Statements that return values, as exemplified by Ruby </li>

  <li>Syntax for matrix/array manipulation (MATLAB) </li>

  <li>Extension methods (boo, C# 3.0) </li>

  <li>Nullable types </li>

  <li>Embedded SQL </li>

  <li>String interpolation, regex strings, multiline strings, ...
  </li>

  <li>Algebraic types (Haskell), variant types (Nemerle) </li>

  <li>Tuples </li>

  <li>Billions of ideas for &ldquo;syntactic sugar&rdquo;
and &ldquo;shortcuts&rdquo; </li>

</ul>

Most of these ideas require both new
code in the compiler and some kind of syntax to invoke them. There
are also whole syntax paradigms:
<ul>

  <li>Whitespace is ignored (C++, C#, Java, ...) or indicates
structure (Python, boo, ...) </li>

  <li>Executable diagrams; visual programming </li>

  <li>Embedded code (Welcome to our web site, &lt;%= userName
%&gt;!) </li>

  <li>Style concerns: braces {} vs. begin/end pairs?
&ldquo;if expr then&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;if(expr)&rdquo;?</li>

</ul>

There are also&nbsp;interoperability
concerns that cause no end of headaches to professionals:
<br>

<ul>

  <li>Interoperability between code written in different
languages </li>

  <li>Multiple platform support (Mac/Windows/Linux/Web
Browser/Pocket PC/Palm) </li>

  <li>Versioning issues </li>

</ul>

<p>For a long time I had wanted to build
The Ultimate Programming language, until I realized that this is
impossible. For one thing, everyone's ideal language may be
different. For another thing, it would be too much work to write all
the needed features myself!
</p>

<p>I have come to realize that each and
every one of the features listed above is very useful in some
circumstances. Sometimes functional code offers the most elegant
solution to a problem; sometimes imperative code is better. Usually
ordinary functions are enough, but sometimes a coroutine makes life a
whole lot easier. Often single inheritance + interfaces are fine, but
without multiple inheritance or traits, you may be forced to copy the
same exact method into several different classes, or you may implement
an "unnatural" design just to avoid code duplication.
</p>

<p>Most language designers choose between
functional or imperative programming, and between static or dynamic
typing. Then they select a limited set of features from the list
above, and the user is stuck with whatever features the designer
picks. Because no language has a truly comprehensive set of features,
a highly skilled programmer cannot have all desired features at once.
Many programmers work in specialized fields where they could use some
features that no &ldquo;general purpose language&rdquo; would
ever
provide; for example, someone writing code for a microcontroller
needs a way to write interrupt handlers. Because of this, the coder's
choices may be limited: he may have to&nbsp;a domain-specific
language
(in this case, probably assembly language). Thus the programmer is shut
out from
various&nbsp;features that exist in his preferred language, but not
in
the domain-specific language.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe that programmers shouldn't
have to make these trade-offs. I might want high performance generic
types, so I pick C++&mdash;but then I miss out on Eiffel's
efficient
multiple inheritance, C#'s closures, boo's brevity, Haskell's type
inference, and of course, garbage collection. We should realize that
it is both feasible and useful to have all these features available
in the same language. Maybe not all in the same lexical block, and
maybe not all at the same time, but a programmer should be able to use
any set of compatible features together in the same binary (.EXE or
.DLL).
</p>

<p>
And did I mention that I'd like to mix
C code, VB code, and C# code in the same project? It's not that I would
<span style="font-style: italic;">plan</span>
to do such a thing, of course, but imagine if you wrote a 50,000 line C
program a few years back and it contains a 5,000-line
algorithm&nbsp;that would be really useful today in your C#
program,
wouldn't it be nice if you didn't have to rewrite it?
</p>

<p>
Users need a way to take a good
language and make it better&mdash;to tailor it to their specific
needs. This has been attempted in the past, with varying degrees of
success:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>LISP offers macros, which by some criminal negligence have
been ignored by the designers of Java, C#, et al. It's a powerful
feature, but many people (including me) don't want to use the
S-expression syntax. </li>

  <li>Nemerle offers its own macros, which are pretty awesome,
but the syntax can't be customized and it's not powerful enough for
complicated features like compile-time unit checking. </li>

  <li>boo offers the mechanisms of &ldquo;macros&rdquo;
and custom compiler pipelines. But you can't add any new syntax without
forking the parser, and a compiler pipeline must be custom-built, so
you can't&nbsp;combine compiler steps (features) written by
different people without at least developing a pipeline. Also, the code
is brittle, and mostly undocumented at the moment. The
ProcessMethodBodies class is scary. </li>

  <li>Ruby offers self-modifying code, continuations, and other
whiz-bang stuff, making some very interesting features
possible&mdash;that is, if you can tolerate astonishingly low
performance. </li>

</ul>

<p>
That's why I've started the Loyc
initiative. My idea is to have a highly flexible, modular compiler
architecture to which features can be freely added. Loyc will be to
computer languages as Eclipse is to IDEs. Or better yet, as SharpDvelop
is to IDEs (because Eclipse is a damn slow resource hog. Apologies to
its authors.)
</p>

<p>
It will consist of a set of basic
features and interfaces&mdash;a framework&mdash;on top of which
a
language can be built. The parser, feature set, and back-end will be
customizable. There will be standard language(s), just as there is a
standard version of Eclipse, but almost any component can be swapped
out for something else. A key objective of Loyc is to maximize the
degree to which features can be re-used in different environments.
For example:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>If a class contains an overloaded operator, it should be
available whether one is using a Python-style syntax or a C#-style
syntax. </li>

  <li>Delegates should be available whether the back-end is Java
bytecode, the .NET framework, or a C object file.</li>

  <li>Inside a block of code that has a special customized
syntax,&nbsp;pre-existing syntax elements such as expressions and
function declarations can be re-used.</li>

  <li>Extensions can invoke other extensions.</li>

</ul>

<p>
As far as possible, a feature should be
available regardless of the front- or back-end in use. Preferably, a
feature should only have to be written once and then can be used in
any environment. This is not always be possible, of course, but a
well-designed framework can help.
</p>

<p>
Another design goal is to minimize
contention between different features and provide ways to resolve
contentions when they arise. For example, Loyc will allow users to
define their own operators, but different operators created by
different people may lead to ambiguity. Mechanisms will be needed to
avoid ambiguities&nbsp;and detect when they arise. Another example:
functional
programming is based on immutable objects, so how can it be combined
with imperative code that mutates objects? How can it interact with the
.NET framework class library? Frankly, I don't know, but
I hope that the broader community can suggest answers.
</p>

<p>The compiler pipeline will follow a
general form: there will be a front-end, a set of transformation steps
performed by extensions, and a back-end; the lines between these parts
may be fuzzy.
</p>

<p>
There will be some constraints:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Loyc is a compiler, not an interpreter, so run-time
meta-programming and self-modifying code may be possible eventually,
but not in the first versions, and it may not be an easy thing to add. </li>

  <li>It will be statically typed, but dynamic "duck"
typing can be added on top. Other styles of typing (e.g. objects that
are partially static and partially dynamic) will be possible. </li>

  <li>The initial target platform will be the .NET
framework (2.0 or
3.0) and Mono; this should provide a &ldquo;quick start&rdquo;
to the
project, because .NET provides so many services and is designed to
support new programming languages. Through Mono, Loyc will run on
Linux, Mac, and Windows. Eventually it should target the Compact
Framework so it can work on Windows CE (Pocket PC / Windows Mobile),
assuming Microsoft allows this. I do not plan to work on any other
back-ends personally, and the .NET framework will be the platform of
the compiler, regardless of the target platform.&nbsp;P.S. I wish
OLPC and Mono would get
together and do a .NET Compact Framework for OLPC. </li>

  <li>The compiler itself will run on .NET, so it can be
self-hosting and dynamically linked. </li>

</ul>

<p>
There will be a basic set of features
available by default, and additional features that can be enabled
with command-line options. Even more features can be added by the
user. It will be possible to rewrite the compiler executable itself
to change the basic composition of the compiler pipeline, and it will
be possible to re-use components in order to make an editor with
&ldquo;intellisense&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The standard feature set will include:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>A C#-style syntax </li>

  <li>A boo-style syntax </li>

  <li>Traits (an object-oriented class system more powerful than
.NET's own) </li>

  <li>Value and reference types </li>

  <li>Value types composed from traits (to bypass .NET's
no-inheritance rule for value types) </li>

  <li>Namespaces </li>

  <li>Exceptions </li>

  <li>Static typing </li>

  <li>Closures </li>

  <li>Enumerator functions </li>

  <li>Static unit checking</li>

  <li>Pointers (for C code and C# "unsafe" code)</li>

  <li>Most other features of .NET</li>

</ul>

There will also be a small standard class/trait library which itself
relies on the .NET framework library.
<p>In much the same way as a windowing toolkit abstracts away the
features of the underlying window system,
Loyc will provide its own features independently of the underlying
platform. However, in order to get something done quickly, the
features will generally copy those provided by .NET and C#.
</p>

<p>
Other features will be built on top of
the basic set and really useful ones may be enabled by default.
</p>

<h2>Not just a compiler</h2>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>It will be
possible to take
parts of the compiler and use them for different purposes.
The&nbsp;design of the compiler architecture should consider the
needs
of<br>

<ol>

  <li>Source tweaking tools: taking a program, parsing it, making
small
changes and emitting the result as a new source file, keeping the
original spacing and comments (unless, of course, the tool's job is to
modify whitespace and comments).</li>

  <li>Syntax translation tools: taking source code and changing
its syntax to that of a new language</li>

  <li>Semantic translation tools: taking&nbsp;source code and
changing its structure to do the same tasks in a new way</li>

  <li>Refactoring tools: making specific user-directed
transformations on-demand, probably in an IDE</li>

  <li>Smart text editors: "syntax" highlighting based on code
semantics
as well as syntax; using knowledge of program structure to display
completion lists and other information; ability to hide code based on
structure; showing call graphs and dependency graphs; finding
errorseven before compiling. </li>

  <li>Quick compilation: pre-parsing code in a text editor so it
builds faster when the user wants to run the code</li>

  <li>Interactive usage: typing statements/expressions and
getting an immediate result</li>

  <li>Edit and continue: applying a user's&nbsp;code changes
to a running program<br>

  </li>

</ol>

I'm not saying Loyc will have all these features--that could take
years, even if I have a lot of help. But the architecture should not
make any of the above tools excessively hard to write.
The&nbsp;compiler should be modularized in such a way that the
above
tools do not have to re-write or even re-compile any functionality that
exists in the compiler itself.<br>

<br>

Currently I'm not thinking about the needs of debuggers; I can't think
that far ahead.<br>

<br>

For example, a code editor that does basic syntax highlighting should
be able to use the same parser in the same DLL that is used
by&nbsp;the
compiler. A parser design that reads directly from a file, or that must
parse a whole file at once, is unsuitable.
<h2>A brief history of Loyc</h2>

I wanted to make a programming language ever since I became frustrated
with mainstream languages in the year 2000. I wrote an incomplete
specification for
a&nbsp;never-developed language called QDL, which by my standards
today&nbsp;isn't that
great. As time passed my ideas for The Ultimate Language evolved until
if finally clicked - I figured out a reasonable way for my ultimate
language to work. At some point I figured out that I wanted a language
in which the syntax was extensible and in which users could write their
own extensions. I realized that I wanted a minimal "core" language on
which most standard features are an "extension".<br>

<br>

I knew I wanted
syntax extensions and functionality enhancements, and I had it stuck in
my head that users would be able to define new syntax and semantics in
a source file and then immediately start using that functionality in
the very same file. But no matter how much I thought about it, I
couldn't find a reasonable way for this to work, especially given that
I wanted a language compatible with smart editors that track the
structure of a program as it is written.<br>

<br>

Luckily I was inspired
by boo's separate extension model, in which extensions can be written
in boo (or any other .NET language), compiled, and then invoked by
modifying the command-line arguments to the compiler. Boo's extension
system was insufficient, as I learned when I wrote a unit-checking
extension for it, and I felt alienated by boo's author (who ignored me
completely). I decided that a language in which&nbsp;syntax
extensions
would be allowed or rejected at one individual's sole discretion was
not
the <span style="font-style: italic;">right way</span>&trade;
for
things to work. Boo allows the compiler pipeline to be replaced, so
someone writing a new compiler step&nbsp;must write code to
construct a
pipeline that includes the new step. Thus, trouble appears as soon as
someone wants to use more than one new step. Finally, there would be a
performance problem&nbsp;if many steps were added, because every
step
must scan the&nbsp;AST looking for whatever it wants to process,
although the step may only care about&nbsp;a few nodes.<br>

<br>

Once I had the basic premise of storing extensions in
dynamically-linked .NET assemblies, it became much easier to design the
rest of the system. For five of the years between 2000 and 2007 I went
to the University of Calgary and got a computer engineering degree, so
I have learned a heck of a lot since designing QDL. I would have
learned more in Computer Science, but at least I took a course in
compiler construction and learned the basics of Haskell. And of course,
in my free time I was looking at various academic literature (and not
understanding most of it). Anyway, the new knowledge I gained was
invaluable (I mean valuable) in helping me design this system.<br>

<br>

Loyc is still at early stages of development, so stay tuned as history
is formed.<br>
