	/// <code>
	///     interface ISource&lt;out T> : IEnumerable&lt;T>, ICount {}
	/// </code>
	/// with Microsoft's IReadOnlyCollection(T), the compiler complains constantly about 
	/// "Ambiguity between IReadOnlyCollection(T).Count and ICount.Count". Eliminating
	/// ICount from most places seems to be the only solution.

	/// <summary>
	/// This class contains extension methods that are provided as part of various 
	/// Loyc.Collections interfaces. For example, it provides methods such as IndexOf(),
	/// Contains() and CopyTo(), that the traditional <see cref="ICollection{T}"/> 
	/// and <see cref="IList{T}"/> interfaces require the author to write himself.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// For covariant collections such as <see cref="IReadOnlyCollection{T}"/> and <see 
	/// cref="IListSource{T}"/>, the CLR actually prohibits methods such as 
	/// Contains(T) and IndexOf(T), because T is not allowed in "input" positions. 
	/// Therefore, these extension methods must be used to fill the gap. Even
	/// methods such as <i>bool TryGet(int, out T)</i> are prohibited, so TryGet()
	/// has the signature <i>T TryGet(ref bool failed)</i> instead, and extension
	/// methods provide the original version of the method in addition.
	/// </remarks>
